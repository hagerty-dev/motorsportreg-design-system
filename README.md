# The MotorsportReg Design System

###### The MSR Design system contains documentation, tools and standards that support us in developing accessible, cohesive and quality experiences at MSR.

This philosophy lives as a collection of our visual assets, icons, design tokens, Vue components, utilities and documentation which tie it all together.

This document and system of tokens aims to provide developers and designers alike with tooling and assets to help us build consistent customer UI's efficiently using Figma and Vue.

<strong>Note:</strong> While this documentation project is ongoing, this is an intial effort to capture our philosophy.
