# MotorsportReg Design System

###### Contained in this document are tools and standards that support us in developing accessible, cohesive and quality experiences at MSR.

Our design philosophy lives as a collection of our visual assets, icons, design tokens, Vue components, utilities and documentation which tie it all together.

And we aim to provide our developers and designers alike with tooling and assets to help us build consistent customer UI's efficiently using Figma and Vue.

<strong>Note:</strong> While this documentation project is ongoing, this is an intial effort to capture our philosophy.
