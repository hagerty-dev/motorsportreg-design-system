# Frequently asked questions

## What is a design token ?

Tokens are thoughtfully named css values that we use across the library to
build our components. They can also be used to create new or custom features with
the MDS visual language. They define decisions such as spacing, size, color and more and are carefully name spaced to aid usability.

## How do I use tokens ?

...

## I can't find a token that has what I need

1. Does it make sense to create a token for this use case?
2. Can the design be adjusted to use an existing tokens instead? For example, can we use an exisitng 48px or 56px space token instead of adding a 52px token?
3. If we really need the new value, will it be re-usable for other features or is it a snowflake?\*
4. If it makes sense to create a new token and not a snowflake, discuss your use case with the design team and confirm there is no existing token for your needs
5. Ask the design team to add the token for you.

    Does it make sense to modify a component for this use case? Will the modifications be resuable for other features or is it a snowflake?*
    If it makes sense to modify an exisiting component and not create a snowflake, discuss your use case with the design team and confirm there is no existing component for your needs.
    Ask the design team to create a prototype with the required modifications for you. Use this prototype design to build a prototype component.
    Review the prototype with the design team and product team to ensure the modifications fit the use case. If not, iterate on the prototype until it does.
    Ask the design team to update the component design in the design system.
    Add the modifications to the component in the design system.
    Use the new component in your feature.
