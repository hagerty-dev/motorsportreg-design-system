# Contributing

You can find a useful governance process above. Use it to decide when to use an existing component, modify an existing component, add a new component or build a custom component for your feature.

## Report an issue

## Propose a new component

## Update a component, or token, or document

## I can't find a token that has what I need

1. Does it make sense to create a token for this use case?
   - Can the design be adjusted to use an existing tokens instead? For example, can we use an exisitng `48px` or `56px` space token instead of adding a `52px` token?
   - If we really need the new value, will it be re-usable for other features or is it a snowflake?\*
1. If it makes sense to create a new token and not a snowflake, discuss your use case with the design team and confirm there is no existing token for your needs.
1. Ask the design team to add the token for you.

## I can find a component that almost does what I need, but not quite

1. Does it make sense to modify a component for this use case? Will the modifications be resuable for other features or is it a snowflake?\*
1. If it makes sense to modify an exisiting component and not create a snowflake, discuss your use case with the design team and confirm there is no existing component for your needs.
1. Ask the design team to create a prototype with the required modifications for you. Use this prototype design to build a prototype component.
1. Review the prototype with the design team and product team to ensure the modifications fit the use case. If not, iterate on the prototype until it does.
1. Ask the design team to update the component design in the design system.
1. Add the modifications to the component in the design system.
1. Use the new component in your feature.

1. Build the new component in the design system.
1. Use the new component in your feature.

## I am confused or stuck with something and I don't know how to proceed

1. Reach out to the design system team in the #design-system channel on Slack.

\* A snowflake is a token or component that is not reusable and is not intended to be used by other features, so you may build it as part of your feature. It should not be added to the design system.
